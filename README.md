# BluetoothController
## A mobile app used to control a drone via bluetooth
We are currently working on an android app to control a drone via bluetooth.
The controller UI consists of two joysticks, which are responsible for piloting the drone. A mockup can be found [here](https://app.moqups.com/sguertl/jfRWDm1V0m/view).

### Useful commands:
Set screen orientiation in [Activity(...)]: *ScreenOrientation = Android.Content.PM.ScreenOrientation.Landscape*

Set theme (e.g. no title bar) in [Activity(...)]: *Theme = "@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar"*

Set fullscreen in [Activity(...)]: *Theme = "@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"*
